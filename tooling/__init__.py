"""Deterministic tooling helpers for integration tests.

This package provides retry helpers, injected clocks, Excel-safe exporters,
logging utilities, Prometheus metrics wiring, pytest plugin shims, and a
minimal FastAPI middleware app used in integration tests.

All modules assume Asia/Tehran timezone and avoid wall-clock reads. Public
APIs are intentionally small and documented via docstrings for clarity.
